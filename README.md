# Walmart-Confidence-Interval-CLT
This project is all about utilizing the concepts of Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem to to analyze the customer purchase behavior against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. 

## **Overview**
This project is all about using the concepts of Confidence Intervals and Central Limit Theorem, where confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for population parameters, while the central limit theorem justifies the use of normal distribution for sample means. These concepts are essential for making inferences about populations based on sample data and have wide-ranging applications in statistics, research, and various fields that rely on data analysis.

## **Project Flow** 
  1. Data Pre-Processing
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Application of CLT (Central Limit Theorem)
  4. Conclusions and Recommendations

## **Dataset**
